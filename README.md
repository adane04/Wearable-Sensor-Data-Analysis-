# Smart-belt-
In this sensor data analysis, data from acceleration and gyroscope sensors collected through a smart belt sensor is utilized. The analysis employs both classical machine learning techniques such as SVM and RF, as well as a 1D CNN with LSTM model. One of the aspects studied is how increasing the window sequence length impacts the performance of the action recognition model based on the belt sensor dataset.
